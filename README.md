# Iris Classification Deployment

This repository contains the deployment of an Iris classification machine learning model. The project is designed to classify iris flowers into one of three species: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, or *Iris-virginica* based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Features

- Built with Python
- Machine learning model trained using the Scikit-learn library
- Simple and intuitive web interface for predictions
- Deployed using Flask
